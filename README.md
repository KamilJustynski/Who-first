# Who-first

A short browser game for two people.

Rules:

Launcher of the player who gets 100 points first. If any player is kicked out of number 1, they lose points that are not "frozen" and the turn is transferred to that person. If you receive points that "freeze" you, give them the turn to a friend without risking it!
